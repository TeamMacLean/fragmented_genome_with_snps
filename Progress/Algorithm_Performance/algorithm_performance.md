Algorithm performance 13/06/14
========================================================

Here I assess the performance of many replicate runs of my genetic algorithm. Each replicate has a different colour in the figures below. The x axis shows the number of generations of the genetic algorithm, and the y axis shows the range of score values (0.0..1.0) that can be attributed to a permutation. These score values are either the fitness, or a distance metric, depending on the figure. The closer the value is to 0, the closer to being correct that permutation is. The ribbon shows the standard deviation for each population, and the line runs through the means. Each facet in the plot, contains replicates with the same parameters. The parameter groups are described below:
