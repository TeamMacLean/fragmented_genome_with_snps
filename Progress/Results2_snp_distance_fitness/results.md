Results 14th July: Genetic algorithm run with SNP distances fitness method
========================================================

The figure below shows the results of 40 replictates of the genetic algorithm with the parameter groupings in the table above. Although there appears to be some initial improvement in terms of fitness score, all the replicates level out within 60 generations.

The figure below shows the same results as the one above, but with the addition of the correct permutation's fitness. This is shown on the line created from "replicate C". Clearly none of the replicates have produced permutations with fitness scores close to that of the correctly ordered genome.
