Rearrangement method ideas

Machine learning
-----

Learning involves giving the machine examples, then the more examples, the better the machine gets at telling how a new thing should be catagorized. For example, a machine learning system could be trained on email messages to learn to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.

Hill Climbing algorithms
------

An arbitrary solution to a problem is generated, then an element of the solution is changed, if this produces a better solution, it is kept. Iteratively, the solution gets better. It can however, reach a local maxima, where changing one element cannot make a better solution, whilst the global maxima (the best possible solution) is not actually reached.
